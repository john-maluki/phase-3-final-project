# DOG ADOPTION CLI APP (PHASE-3-FINAL-PROJECT)

The dog adoption app is a command-line interface application designed to simplify the dog adoption
process for anyone willing to have one.

### Problem Statement:

Stray dogs, that continue to live on streets, even if they are sterilized, will still bite, chase people and vehicles, get into accidents, suffer from hunger and disease, and remain in conflict with people. Therefore, the dog adoption app enables people with or without dogs to adopt them and minimize the effect.
